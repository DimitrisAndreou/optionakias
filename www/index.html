  <ul>
    <li><a href="ibkr.html">IBKR Realized/Unrealized P&L by Symbol</a>.
      Interactive Brokers unfortunately still doesn't offer a way to
      sum up your P&L via a symbol (e.g. the P&L of your AAPL stock,
      <b>together</b> with all the P&Ls of the <b>options</b> on AAPL).
      This tool does this.
    </li>
    <li><a href="bybit.html">BTC/ETH Options Analyzer</a> (via ByBit's data).
      Basically this adds extra features to a typical option chain,
      for example it can explain selling a put as a trade that gives you
      a certain break even improvement, for agreeing to a bounded max gain (%),
      versus unlimited upside of buying the underlying on the spot market.
      Simple things like this can make options more digestable for newcomers.
