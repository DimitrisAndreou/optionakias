        This tool lets IBKR users see the realized/unrealized Profit & Loss (PNL)
        for all their positions, grouped by symbol. I.e. if you traded
        50 different option contracts of a particular stock (and maybe
        traded the stock itself), you will here see a <b>single</b> position,
        instead of the 50 (or 51) that IBKR would report.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use this, simply download "Realized & Unrealized" CSV reports
        provided by IBKR (you can select many). Ideally you should select
        all CSV since inception of your IBKR account, and make sure the CSV
        files do not refer to overlapping periods (otherwise the PNL of the
        overlapping periods will be double-counted).

        Note that this script processes the files locally, never sends your
        files anywhere (it doesn't require an internet connection to work).
